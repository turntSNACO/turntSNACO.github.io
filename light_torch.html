        <p>You light your torch and illluminate the face of a friendly and wise bearded old man. He says to you, "Greetings adventurer! I am the Merchant of the Mystical Forest. Would you like to buy any of the Merchant of the Mystical Forest's mystical magical items?" You only have 10 gold though.</p>
